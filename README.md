# Security System Project

This project is a comprehensive security system implementation in C++. It provides functionalities such as registration, login, validation of user details, password strength evaluation, system lock/unlock, password recovery, and password expiration. The system aims to ensure secure user authentication, password management, and system access control.

## Features

- Registration: Allows users to create an account by providing their desired username and password.
- Login: Authenticates users by verifying their username and password against the stored credentials.
- User Details Validation: Validates user inputs during registration, ensuring that required fields are not empty and meet specific criteria (e.g., valid email format).
- Password Strength Validation: Evaluates the strength of a password based on predefined criteria (e.g., length, complexity) to ensure stronger passwords are chosen.
- System Lock/Unlock: Provides the ability to lock and unlock the system, restricting or allowing user access to sensitive resources.
- Password Recovery: Allows users to recover their forgotten passwords by following a password reset procedure, typically involving security questions or email verification.
- Password Expiration: Enforces password expiration policies to enhance security, prompting users to change their passwords periodically.
